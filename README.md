# Welcome to Smart Expense Tracker with Budget Insights!

Hey there! üëã This project is all about making your financial life easier. With Smart Expense Tracker, you can keep tabs on your daily spending, set monthly budgets, and get smart insights‚Äîall powered by the cloud and AWS magic.

---

## üåü What Can You Do Here?

- **Track your expenses:** Log every coffee, cab, or grocery run in seconds.
- **Set budgets:** Decide how much you want to spend each month and get notified if you go over.
- **Scan receipts:** Just snap a photo‚Äîour app uses AWS Textract to read and categorize your expenses automatically.
- **See your spending trends:** Beautiful charts and reports (thanks to Amazon QuickSight) help you understand where your money goes.
- **Store everything securely:** All your receipts and docs are safe in Amazon S3, and only you can access them.
- **Global access:** Fast, secure access anywhere in the world via CloudFront.
- **Stay private:** Your data is protected with Cognito authentication.
- **Get alerts:** If you bust your budget, you‚Äôll get a friendly nudge via SNS.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works (Architecture)

### High-Level AWS Deployment Flow

1. **User Interaction:**
	- Users access the Angular app via a CloudFront distribution, which serves the static site from an S3 bucket for fast, global delivery.
	- Authentication is handled by Amazon Cognito, ensuring secure access to user-specific features and data.

2. **Receipt Upload & OCR:**
	- Users upload receipt images through the Angular app.
	- Images are sent directly to an S3 bucket (using signed URLs or via API Gateway).
	- An S3 event triggers an AWS Lambda function, which calls AWS Textract to extract text and data from the receipt.

3. **Expense Processing & Storage:**
	- The Lambda function parses the Textract output, categorizes the expense, and updates the user's records in DynamoDB.
	- DynamoDB stores all expense and budget data, indexed by user.

4. **Budget Monitoring & Alerts:**
	- Another Lambda function (or Step Function workflow) monitors expenses against user budgets.
	- If a user exceeds their budget, the function publishes a notification to an SNS topic, which sends alerts (email/SMS/push).

5. **Reporting & Insights:**
	- Expense data in DynamoDB is visualized using Amazon QuickSight dashboards, which users can access via secure links or embedded views in the app.

6. **API Gateway:**
	- API Gateway exposes RESTful endpoints for the Angular app to interact with backend services (e.g., fetch expenses, update budgets, trigger reports).
	- All endpoints are protected with Cognito authorizers for security.

7. **Step Functions (Optional):**
	- For complex workflows (e.g., multi-step receipt processing, batch reporting), AWS Step Functions orchestrate Lambda invocations and error handling.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to roll? Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Clone the repo & install dependencies:**
	 ```bash
	 npm install
	 ```
2. **Build the Angular app:**
	 ```bash
	 ng build --configuration production
	 ```
3. **Deploy:** Upload the `/dist` folder to your S3 bucket (set up for static website hosting).
4. **Set up AWS:** Use CloudFormation or the AWS Console to create:
	 - S3 buckets for receipts/docs
	 - Cognito User Pool
	 - Lambda functions for OCR & expense processing
	 - DynamoDB tables
	 - API Gateway endpoints
	 - SNS topics for alerts
	 - QuickSight dashboards
	 - CloudFront distribution
5. **Configure your app:** Add your AWS resource ARNs, endpoints, and keys to `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`.

## üß© Example: Uploading a Receipt to S3

Here‚Äôs a quick peek at how you might upload a receipt from Angular:

```typescript
// src/app/services/aws-s3.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class AwsS3Service {
	private s3 = new S3Client({ region: 'YOUR_REGION', credentials: {/* ... */} });

	async uploadReceipt(file: File, userId: string) {
		const params = {
			Bucket: 'YOUR_RECEIPT_BUCKET',
			Key: `${userId}/${file.name}`,
			Body: file,
			ContentType: file.type,
		};
		return await this.s3.send(new PutObjectCommand(params));
	}
}
```

## üîí Security First

- Your data is locked down with Cognito authentication.
- S3 buckets are private‚Äîaccess only via signed URLs.
- API Gateway endpoints are protected with Cognito authorizers.

---

## üí° Pro Tips & Troubleshooting

- Double-check your AWS credentials and ARNs in the environment files.
- CORS issues? Update your API Gateway and S3 bucket policies.
- Build errors? Run `npm install` to make sure all dependencies are there.
- Authentication not working? Verify your Cognito User Pool and client IDs.
